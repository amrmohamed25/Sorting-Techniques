# Sorting-Techniques
Sorting is one of the most fundamental algorithmic problems within computer science. The 
wide variety of algorithms gives us a lot of richness to explore, especially in terms of 
efficiency, code complexity, best/worst case inputs, and so on.
This program performs six different sorting techniques on a randomly generated arrays of 
different sizes (10, 10000, 55000, 100000, 145000, 190000, 235000). Three of these sorting 
techniques have time complexity O(n^2), which are Selection Sort, Bubble Sort and 
Insertion Sort, while the other three have time complexity O(nlgn), which are Heap Sort, 
Merge Sort and Quick Sort.
After sorting the original array, the program prints the time taken by each sorting technique
and asks the user whether he wants to print the array or not. The calculated time is then 
plotted against the different sizes of the array to show the time complexity of each one of 
them.
